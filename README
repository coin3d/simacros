README
======

This module contains autoconf macros which are shared between several
SIM projects, or macros which so far are used only in one project but
are generic enough to be reusable in future projects.

The code for all macros should be considered to be in the Public Domain,
unless otherwise specified.  If you use any one of these macros in your
own projects and make improvements, please let us know so we can
incorporate your modifications.
