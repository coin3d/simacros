* [mortene:19991127] submit the macros which can be useful for other
  developers to the autoconf macro archive at
  <http://peti.cys.de/autoconf-archive>.

* [mortene:19990924] clean up some of the macros a bit by making new
  macros SIM_ARG_WITH_BOOL, SIM_ARG_WITHOUT_BOOL, SIM_ARG_ENABLE_BOOL
  and SIM_ARG_DISABLE_BOOL?

* [larsa:20000220] consider collecting our m4 utility-macros (at the
  moment consisting only of the sim4_compact(STRING) macro) in a
  separate file to avoid duplicating them all over the place.
